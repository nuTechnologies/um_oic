# xwork Design System

The **xwork Design System** provides you and your team with a set of components and utilities for
application and extension development within the xwork Web ecosystem.

The design system is bundled with xwork Web, so you can and should just use the components and utilities
you find in this documentation. This helps us in building a common visual language for the whole ecosystem.
